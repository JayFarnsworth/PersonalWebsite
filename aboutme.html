          <h4>Where I'm From</h4>
            <img src=jedi.jpg class=pic>
            <p> I grew up in Boulder, CO. I spent most of high school making movies and playing video games. I became a pro at filming and editing my own pictures, which has proved to be a valuable skill that I've yet to use once after graduating. </p>

          <h4>My Education</h4>
          <img src=asu.jpg class=pic>
            <p>I attended Arizona State for three years, where I majored in Political Science. I originally wanted to be a lawyer, I guessed. I mostly hung around pools and spent time anywhere within 500 miles that wasn't class. This would explain the whopping 30 credits I received in my time there. </p>
            <p>I transferred to CU Boulder following a solid session of getting my life together. I plowed through the other 3/4 of my degree in 2 years. I met many other bro/ hipster/ nerd/ wook friends to round out my collection. <br><br>

          <h4>My Love</h4>
            <img src=car.jpg class=pic>
            <p>I love to drive long distances. My car, lil crimson, has largely taken the place of a dog/ girlfriend/ job over the years. I've put 100k miles on her in our 5 years together. We drive all over the west. I tell people in bars that I know how to fix her because I'm usually present when someone else is doing it. </p>

          <h4>Other Stuff</h4>
            <img src=petro.jpg class=pic>
            <p>-Seeing LIVE MUSIC, mostly jam bands, "underground" electronic, and various rock bands. I try to blend in to wherever I am.<br></p>
            <p>-MOVIES. My favorites are The Good The Bad and the Ugly, 2001: a Space Oddysey, and No Country for Old Men.<br></p>
            <p>-POLITICS. Topics most important to me: Prison reform, drug reform, ending corperate welfare, and fixing our broken campaign finance laws.<br></p>
            <p>-Environmentalism/ western conservation<br></p>
            <p>-Giving groups of tourists fake points of historial interest<br></p>

          <h4>Work</h4>
            <img src=sister.jpg class=picrotate>
            <p>I lived in SF for about a year after graduating. I worked sales at Yelp, which fulfilled a lifelong dream of being yelled at over the phone all day.<br><br> I moved back to Colorado and my most recent job was sales for a programmatic ad exchange, Sovrn. I learned to write emails that wouldn't get deleted immediately.<br><br>
            After the company cut 75% of its sales team, I took a year. I spent this time exploring programming as a career. Once my lease in Boulder was up in the spring I lived on the road. I spent most of my summer in Southern California/ Baja California. I got it all out of my system before starting Galvanize.</p>
