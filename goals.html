      <h3>GOALS</h3>
        <p>I’m thrilled to have made such a severe career shift. I’m hoping to ride out this wave of excitement through what will surely be a long, dark winter in the Galvanize basement.<br><br><br><br></p>
      <h3>Inspiration</h3>
        <p>earning to code in my mind, but I wouldn’t pursue it until I was let go from my next job in Colorado.<br><br><br><br> </p>
      <h3>Future?</h3>
        <p>My ultimate goal is, like most at Galvanize, gainful employment as a full stack developer. I won’t speculate about what I’ll be doing in six months as I’m certain I haven’t learned it yet.
           <br><br>I’d love to eventually be able to work remotely, a large draw for me to programming. Within 3 years I hope to try out life working as a “digital nomad.” Building stuff is far more
           rewarding than talking to people every day. There’s been a ton of administrative and managerial bloat in every sales job I’d have so far, so distancing myself from that kind of work environment is something I see as critical to my happiness.</p>
